# Mule Project `batch-contacts-csv-to-db`

The Mule project `batch-contacts-csv-to-db` provides a foundational example of batch processing in Mule 4. The implementation is intended as a starting point for understanding core Mule batch processing concepts without introducing unnecessary integration complexity. The application uses the SFTP Connector to monitor a directory for new or updated CSV files containing contact data. When a file is detected, the application reads the contact data and uses a Batch Job component to bulk insert the records into a database. Upon completion of the Batch Job, the application sends a summary report via Gmail.

This folder, `batch-contacts-csv-to-db`, is a complete Mule project that can be imported directly into Anypoint Studio or Anypoint Code Builder.
