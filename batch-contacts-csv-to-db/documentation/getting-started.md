# Getting Started with Mule Project `batch-contacts-csv-to-db`

## Prerequisites

As described in the [Overview](overview.md), the Mule project `batch-contacts-csv-to-db` monitors a directory on an SFTP server for new or updated files. When a file is detected, the application reads the contact data and bulk inserts the records into a database table. Upon completion of the Batch Job, the application sends a summary report via Gmail.

Running the Mule project with the existing implementation requires the following configuration information:

1. **SFTP Server Configuration**:
   - Hostname or IP address.
   - Port number.
   - Username.
   - Password.
   - Working directory containing the following subdirectories:
     - `new` — Monitored by the Mule application for new or updated files using the SFTP Connector.
     - `archive` — Contains files moved after successful processing and error files generated for records that fail during the Batch Job.
     - `failed` — Contains files moved by the error handler when an error or failure occurs outside the Batch Job.
2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Hostname or IP address.
   - Port number.
   - Username.
   - Password.
   - Database name.
3. **Gmail Configuration**:
   - Gmail username.
   - Gmail app password. See the note below.
   - Gmail email address used as the sender, for example, `Max Mule <max.mule@gmail.com>`.
   - Primary email recipient (`To` field). The current implementation supports a single primary recipient.

> [!NOTE]
> As described in [Connect to Gmail with Email Connector Examples - Mule 4](https://docs.mulesoft.com/email-connector/latest/email-gmail), an [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) must be configured for the Gmail account used by the Mule 4 Email Connector.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and import the project `batch-contacts-csv-to-db` into Anypoint Studio.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abelisle-mulesoft/mule-4-batch-job-examples.git
   ```

2. For a `dev` environment, copy the properties template `src/main/resources/properties/app-props.template.yaml` to `src/main/resources/properties/app-props-dev.yaml`.

3. Edit the properties file `src/main/resources/properties/app-props-dev.yaml`.

   At a minimum, configure the following properties for the target environment:

   - **SFTP Connector Configuration**:
     - `sftp.host` — SFTP server hostname or IP address.
     - `sftp.port` — SFTP server port number.
     - `sftp.username` — SFTP server username.
     - `sftp.password` — SFTP server password.
     - `sftp.working_dir` — Base path on the SFTP server containing the `new`, `failed`, and `archive` subdirectories.

   - **Database Connector Configuration**:
     - `postgres_db.host` — Database hostname or IP address.
     - `postgres_db.port` — Database port number, for example, `5432`.
     - `postgres_db.username` — Database username.
     - `postgres_db.password` — Database password.
     - `postgres_db.db_name` — Database name, for example, `postgres`.

   - **Email Connector Configuration**:
     - `gmail.server.username` — Gmail username.
     - `gmail.server.password` — Gmail app password.
     - `gmail.address.from` — Sender email address, which must match the Gmail address.
     - `gmail.address.to` — Recipient email address.

   The following properties can optionally be adjusted for the target environment or processing requirements:

   - **Batch Job Components Configuration**:
     - `batch.job.block_size` — Number of records included in each block when splitting the source data for processing.
   - **SFTP Connector Configuration**:
     - `sftp.new_dir` — Subdirectory within `sftp.working_dir` monitored for new or updated files, for example, `new`.
     - `sftp.failed_dir` — Subdirectory within `sftp.working_dir` where the error handler moves files when an error or failure occurs, for example, `failed`.
     - `sftp.archive_dir` — Subdirectory within `sftp.working_dir` where successfully processed files are moved, for example, `archive`.

4. Compile and run the project in Anypoint Studio as a smoke test.

   The sample file [contact-data-100.csv](../../sample-data/contact-data-100.csv) can optionally be uploaded to the `new` subdirectory on the SFTP server to validate the configuration. Successful processing can be confirmed by verifying that the contact records were inserted into the configured database table and that the source file was moved to the `archive` subdirectory. Upon completion of the Batch Job, the Mule application also sends a summary report via Gmail.
